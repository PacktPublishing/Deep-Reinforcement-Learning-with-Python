</a>With significant enhancement in the quality and quantity of algorithms in recent
years, this second edition of Hands-On Reinforcement Learning with Python has been completely 
revamped into an example-rich guide to learning state-of-the-art reinforcement
learning (RL) and deep RL algorithms with TensorFlow and the OpenAI Gym
toolkit.

In addition to exploring RL basics and foundational concepts such as the Bellman
equation, Markov decision processes, and dynamic programming, this second
edition dives deep into the full spectrum of value-based, policy-based, and actor-
critic RL methods with detailed math. It explores state-of-the-art algorithms such as DQN, TRPO, PPO
and ACKTR, DDPG, TD3, and SAC in depth, demystifying the underlying math and
demonstrating implementations through simple code examples.

The book has several new chapters dedicated to new RL techniques including
distributional RL, imitation learning, inverse RL, and meta RL. You will learn
to leverage Stable Baselines, an improvement of OpenAI's baseline library, to
implement popular RL algorithms effortlessly. The book concludes with an overview
of promising approaches such as meta-learning and imagination augmented agents
in research.
